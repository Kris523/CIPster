*) Get rid of Eip integer typedefs.  They seem needless given the Cip typedefs.

*)  Vol2 2-5.5.2

    Close TCP connection when all originated IO connections generated from it
    timeout.

    In the condition where a targetâ€™s CIP connections from an originator all
    time out, the target shall close the TCP connection from that originator
    immediately. The purpose of this behavior is to help prevent half-open CIP
    connections that can result from TCP retries at the originator due to
    link-lost conditions.

    (The inactivity timer in same section is already working.)
