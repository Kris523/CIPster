Volunteer contributions welcome for these:


*) Enhance documentation.  Note that @brief is ugly and it is being removed.
   We have Javadoc flag enabled in Doxygen which does basically the same thing.

*) Revive and/or replace unit tests.

*) Python bindings?

*) Redo IO connection timing, decrementing the timeout for each connection
   may not be optimal as compared to calculating a delta from current time
   as is done in the TCP inactivity timer scheme.

*) Enhance sample applications to at least know their own IP address.
